# What are kernels?

My first introduction to kernels came when I was trying to use support vector machines for a classification problem at work. There's already a lot of other posts out there about kernels in the context of SVMs (e.g. [Kernel Functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/kernel-function-6f1d2be6091), [Kernel Functions-Introduction to SVM Kernel & Examples](https://data-flair.training/blogs/svm-kernel-functions/)). So, a quick definition: given two n-dimensional vectors $x$ and $x^*$ and some function $f(x)$ that maps to m-dimensional space where m is often much larger than n, a kernel computes the dot product of $f(x)$ and $f(x^*)$ without having to explicitly go through the step of calculating the values of $f(x)$ and $f(x^*)$.
